# Venture Funding with Deep Learning

You work as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. This team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The business team has given you a CSV containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.

## Instructions

The steps for this challenge are broken out into the following sections:

* Prepare the data for use on a neural network model.

* Compile and evaluate a binary classification model using a neural network.

* Optimise the neural network model.

## Optimization models:
Totally I tried 9 difrrent models in 3 notebooks as below:
* Try 1 - 3 Layeres - add Droupout layer - add Regularization 
* Try 2 - Remove Classification Column then : 3 Layeres - add Droupout Layer - add Regularization
* Try 3 - Change Activation function then to 'tanh' :  3 Layeres - 4 Layeres - add Regularization /200 Epoc
